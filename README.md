# Revo-Coffee-Website
A website of a coffee shop.
I used a public Figma design. This website is one page only. It's pretty plain, but I'm proud of the "Giftsets" section because the animations are stunning. I used JavaScript and jQuery for that. There is also a slider. I've had experience doing a slider before, but this one isn't just an image slider. It has many elements in it that are positioned in a grid.

You can watch the video showing all the hovers and animations:

(GitHub Pages doesn't show all the assets and scripts, so watch the video)
